EGBE601/602 Signal Processing Final Project:
Image processing with segmentation and classification of White Blood Cell image from Microscope
Firstly, We segment the image by using SAM model. The source code is in "Segmentation.ipynb"
We use FFT, DWT for image processing
We fine tune the image classification model from ViT-based model.
